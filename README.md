### Ursina Gun_Controller for FirstPersonController

As we know the current version of Ursina engine doens't seem to have built in gun_controller or car_controller just yet.

So I modified the FirstPersonController and made the other controller out of it.

**Objects**

* Gun
* Stand Position
* Ground
* (superpositioned) target

**Requirements**

* Python (optional: V 3.12.3)
* Ursina Engine Version 7.0.0 or higher: `pip install ursina`
* threading (built-in)
* delta time (come with ursina)
* random (built-in or with ursina)

**Installation**

To install you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `main.py`

`` **note**: gun_controller.py is just a module, the other copies contain other types of target objects ``
